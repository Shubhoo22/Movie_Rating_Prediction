## Project Overview

This project predicts the ratings of movies based on various features such as:

- Actor average ratings
- Director average ratings
- Movie genres
- Text embeddings of movie descriptions (using sentence embeddings)

The prediction model is trained on a dataset of movies and their ratings, and it outputs a predicted rating for a given movie.
